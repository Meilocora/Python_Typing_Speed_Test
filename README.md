Task is to write a programm with tkinter, that checks your writing speed in words per minute.

My solution checks the writing speed with a 60 sec interval, while showing the number correctly written words and the current words per minute.
There are a few english texts and one of them is randomly shown to the user to copy it.
If the user finishes before the 60 seconds, the timer stops and the final result is shown.
The words are also highlited depending if you wrote them correct or wrong.
By clicking "Start" again all values are being reset and the user (possibly) gets a new text.
